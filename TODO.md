### Current Focus
* Create the sidebar to show the pages within the selected book
    * I want the sidebar to be like a drawer that opens when you selected a book.
        * If you select a different book I want the sidebar to close and then open with the new pages

### What to do next
* Make a global for colors
    * It's better to do this early on 
        * I'd like to be able to do a light mode and a dark mode
* Add auth
* Add the new features
* Make sure the app looks okay on smaller screens
    * move things in the header into a hamburger
    * make the sidebars less wide
        * only allow one sidebar open at a time on smaller screens
* Instead of saying "My Notes" it should maybe say the users name like "Sean's Notes"

### Done
* Get the notes from the API
* Decide on a design for the header
    * How should we display the different sections?
