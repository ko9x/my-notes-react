### Current Focus
* Create the sidebar to show the pages within the selected book
    * I want the sidebar to be like a drawer that opens when you selected a book.
        * If you select a different book I want the sidebar to close and then open with the new pages

### What to do next
* Add auth
* Add the new features

### Done
* Get the notes from the API
* Decide on a design for the header
    * How should we display the different sections?
